    "### Research Question: \n",
    "**Does higher employee satisfaction correlate with better performance scores?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Characteristics:**\n",
    "- **Sample Size:** 104 employees (clean dataset after removing null values)\n",
    "- **Employee Satisfaction Range:** 2.0 to 5.0 (mean: 3.88, std: 0.86)\n",
    "- **Performance Distribution:** \n",
    "  - 81 employees (77.9%) - \"Fully Meets\" expectations\n",
    "  - 10 employees (9.6%) - \"Needs Improvement\" \n",
    "  - 8 employees (7.7%) - \"Exceeds\" expectations\n",
    "  - 5 employees (4.8%) - \"PIP\" (Performance Improvement Plan)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correlation Analysis:**\n",
    "- **Correlation Coefficient:** 0.2943\n",
    "- **P-value:** 0.0024 (p < 0.01)\n",
    "- **Correlation Strength:** Very weak positive correlation\n",
    "- **Statistical Significance:** Very significant (p < 0.01)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weak but Significant Relationship:** The correlation coefficient of 0.294 indicates a very weak positive relationship between employee satisfaction and performance. However, the p-value of 0.0024 shows this relationship is statistically significant, meaning it's unlikely to be due to random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Visual Confirmation:** The scatter plot shows:\n",
    "   - **Wide dispersion** of data points around the trend line, confirming the weak correlation\n",
    "   - **Slight upward slope** of the red trend line, supporting the positive relationship\n",
    "   - **Data clustering** around satisfaction scores of 3.0-4.0 and performance scores of 4.0\n",
    "   - **Outliers present** with some employees showing high satisfaction but low performance, and vice versa\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance Distribution Skew:** The data reveals a heavily skewed performance distribution:\n",
    "   - 77.9% of employees are rated as \"Fully Meets\" expectations\n",
    "   - Only 7.7% exceed expectations\n",
    "   - This suggests either most employees are performing adequately or there may be evaluation criteria issues\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Limited Practical Impact:** The weak correlation (r = 0.294) means employee satisfaction explains only about 8.7% of the variance in performance scores (r² = 0.087), indicating that other factors play a much larger role in determining performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Based on Weak Positive Correlation Found:**\n",
    "- **Don't rely solely on satisfaction** as a performance predictor\n",
    "- **Focus on other factors** that drive performance (training, resources, management quality, job fit)\n",
    "- **Investigate why correlation is weak** - are satisfaction surveys measuring the right factors?\n",
    "- **Consider performance evaluation methods** - 77.9% \"Fully Meets\" suggests potential evaluation issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "- Sample size of 104 employees provides adequate statistical power\n",
    "- Correlation does not imply causation\n",
    "- Other factors (manager quality, job fit, compensation, etc.) may influence both variables\n",
    "- Performance evaluation criteria may be too lenient (ceiling effect)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "**Answer to Research Question:** Yes, higher employee satisfaction does correlate with better performance scores, but the relationship is very weak (r = 0.294). While statistically significant, satisfaction alone is not a reliable predictor of performance outcomes in this organization.\n"
